// Works in all game modes. It reads 3 z-coordinates of camera (not actual player position) periodically
// and calcs speed and acceleration.
// If speed falls into danger zone ( fatalv <-> 1.25 fatalv ) checking for decceleration is enabled ; once decceleration occurs, player is killed. 

// So any wild movement puts you in wounded state; there mild deccelarations kill. For even more realism secondary health
// could be added. Once it is depleted, player is killed.

// To prevent unnecessarr bugs use firstperson view and set thirdpersondistance 0. Note that fall speed ( as coded in source of game ) is 
// not a function of fall height but but of the time spent falling.


// Most of the "bugs" are explained away by noting use of camera position (not actual player position)
// and falling time.



// No more unrealistic falls; unforgiving jumppads. By tweaking fatalv player can become really fragile.
// Real caution needed when playing with this.
